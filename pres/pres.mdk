[In this book of nonfiction based on the journalist's experiential research, 
Ehrenreich attempts to ascertain whether it is currently possible for an 
individual to live on a minimum-wage in America. Taking jobs as a waitress, 
a maid in a cleaning service, and a Walmart sales employee, the author 
summarizes and reflects on her work, her relationships with fellow workers, 
and her financial struggles in each situation.text]{ :xxx-small }

An experienced journalist, Ehrenreich is aware of the limitations of her experiment and the ethical implications of her experiential research tactics and reflects on these issues in the text. The author is forthcoming about her methods and supplements her experiences with scholarly research on her places of employment, the economy, and the rising cost of living in America. Ehrenreichâ€™s project is timely, descriptive, and well-researched.
